# Domotz-Silent-Installer
This installer was originally designed to be run through the SyncroRMM Script Automation. It is available in the SyncroRMM Community Scripts library, and will continue to be updated both in the library and on Github, reflecting any changes that need to be made.

The current Powershell script gets several of the variables from Syncro Variables that are selected when the script is run. In order to add the script manually to the RMM, you will need to add runtime variables for: $$checkversion $apiendpoint $activationkey $agentname 

I will continue working on improving the script, and releasing it as a standalone powershell script, as well as a silent or minimalist exe.
